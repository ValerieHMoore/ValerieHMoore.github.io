As students and job-hunters, we’re exhorted by our advisors to make industry contacts by going to meetups. Yet meetups can inspire terror in first-time attendees, especially students who may not yet feel confident in their technical abilities, or who aren’t natural extroverts. We can’t let our fears get in the way of such a valuable resource. We need to turn this around – literally.

## It’s Not About You
What if you thought about meetups as an opportunity to make someone else feel comfortable? What if you made it your mission to find a person or people there who look anxious or unsure, and put them at ease? Here are some ways to break the ice.

## Learn Something
Start with a meetup that has a speaker or a seminar. You’ll learn something, and have a built-in conversation topic at the social afterwards. You can say something as simple as, “How did you like the speaker?” Or, “What did you learn today?” These are non-controversial openers that focus on the other person.

## Teach Something
You know more than you think you do. Offer the meetup organizers a presentation on something you are familiar with, or ask them what topic they need and then research and present it. Maybe turn it into a codealong for attendees to give everyone something to do and talk about. Take questions to make it more interactive and helpful.

## Start a Meetup
Not finding a group that meets your needs at Meetup.com? Start one as a service to yourself and others. Try an inclusive pitch, such as “Although this group focuses on X, all types of programmers and developers are welcome.” Choose a convenient time and location for your first meeting. If using a café or restaurant, be sure to make a reservation under the group name so guests don’t feel lost when they arrive.

## Hackathon 101
Look for a hackathon that expressly welcomes beginners. I attended one with about a dozen Flatiron women, and within the first few minutes, it became clear that we needed to divide into two teams for group projects. I went around and quickly assessed where everyone was in the curriculum, and put together two teams that were evenly matched in terms of coding experience. Advanced coding skills weren’t necessary for that task, and I learned everyone’s name right away.

## Be Like Amanda
I felt very welcomed at the above-mentioned hackathon because of a Flatiron student. Amanda Berman posted on a Slack channel that she was attending the event, collected everyone’s phone numbers, and put together a WhatsApp chat for us to get to know one another and stay in touch. We each arrived at the meeting already recognizing a dozen friendly faces and names!

## Offer to Help
Volunteer to hand out name tags or swag bags at the event. If you’re on a buffet line and everybody is juggling a plate and a drink, offer your neighbor some items while serving yourself. Come prepared with a few extra pens or highlighters for those who may have forgotten them.

## Give Thanks
It sounds silly, but please and thank you go a long way towards putting others at ease and making a good impression for yourself as well. If you go to a party at someone’s home, you make sure to thank the host or hosts before you leave; do the same for meetup organizers. Make your thankyou specific, so that it can also be a conversation starter: “Thanks so much for your help on X. I can already think of ways to implement that in my ABC app.” Don’t wait until everyone has their coat on and is halfway out the door.

## Conclusion
We’re talking about making professional contacts that will help further your career, now and in the future. Try anything in this article that helps you get over your fears and put yourself out there in the service of others. It will be a win-win!
