Has coding ever made you so mad you wanted to throw your laptop out a window? Has coding ever made you cry? Don’t be ashamed and don’t quit! Realize that your confusion is a temporary state.

First of all, you are not going to learn if you’re upset. Take a break, even a day or two if you’re really not thinking straight. Eat well, hydrate, and catch up on sleep. Stop looking at screens and spend in-person time with friends or family. Get some exercise and spend some time outdoors in nature by going for a walk or hike. You need some sunshine and fresh air. There, that felt good!

Second, try new pathways through the same problem. This is hard, because you may not understand what you don’t understand. Repetition is the key. Repetition is the key :)

Maybe you missed a key concept along the way; go back and review. Speed is not the goal here, understanding is. Take as long as you need to to fully understand. Take notes with pen and paper to open up another route in your brain. Draw a diagram of the code you are trying to set up, and/or write some pseudocode in your lab to describe it. Have different people explain the same concepts to you by asking fellow students or attending a study group with a different instructor. Don’t be embarrassed to ask really basic questions; there are no dumb questions. See if someone can pair with you on the lab, or bring your questions to one of the AMA (“Ask Me Anything”) study groups. Look for online tutorials on the topic for yet another perspective. Online tutorials can take the form of blog posts, videos, or even games to help you learn.

I have a “nine times” rule. When I was a beginner, a colleague needed to explain a function to me nine times before I understood it. Now if I get something in only six tries, I’m happy. Your mileage may vary; the point is to keep trying.
